                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>stella. This is a newly discovered family in a very mysterious place on Earth and is named after Starrie.</p>
           
                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Floats around and stays near water surface.</li>
                    <li>Never stops spinning.</li>
                    <li>Changes spinning speed when people go near or faraway.</li>
                    <li>Two magical pearl-like beads always spin around it.</li>
                    <li>Changing shape and color.</li>
                    <li>Two states: Sleep and awake.</li>
                    <li>Certain patterns appear when it gets close to water surface.</li>
                    <li>A pair of beautiful wings?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>In areas with vast water surfaces, but not all those kind of areas. The water has to be excessively clean, so is the air. In their habitat, stars have to be clearly visible by naked eye in the sky at night. Creatures like Starrie are rarely witnessed, and they are more likely to be witnessed by children and people with some innocence in their heart. Starrie usually shows up at night, especially when shooting stars pass by. It stays close to the surface of the water.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Spinning little spirit with changing color and shape. Also there are two round beads spinning around it. These two beads are said to be transformed from magical pearls deep in ocean. Additionally, some have reported seeing its wings and arms, but there is not yet video or image clues to support this saying.</p>

                <p>Starrie is a cute little magical spirit that floats around water surface in mysterious and the most clean places on Earth, places that few people would ever visit. The habitat are places with extensive water surfaces, and the water and the air is the cleanest on Earth. There should be clearly visible stars all over the sky at night, and there is a higher chance to meet Starrie when shooting stars appear. According to limited report, Starrie is sometimes asleep, and sometimes awake. It never stops spinning and changing colors, and it also changes shapes and spinning speed as people go near it and go far away. Around it spin two pearls that are reportedly from deep ocean and hold the puriest and very sacred power. Some people said that special patterns would appear when it approaches water surface. Nobody but two children (twins) has seen its wings which were "like angel wings and could even change size."</p>

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                <p>In this prototype of Starrie after gathering all information about it, I made several ways to interact with it. Try moving your mouse near or away from it to discover different shapes and spinning speed it got. Try the key codes "z", "x", and "c" to meet it in the status of awake, asleep, or flying! I set the background to be water surface at night, with the moon slowly moving across and stars blinking. To add to that, try pressing you mouse for a surprise!</p>
