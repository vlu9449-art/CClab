    <p>Project Description</p>
    <p>In this project, the star shapes rotate around the top left corner, and they leave traces that ultimately look
      like star
      trail. But to people who love singing and music like me, you may better consider it traces on a record because the
      traces are made faster when you sing louder!
    </p>
    <p>To add more stars, press any key on your keyboard! I have embedded three musical accompaniments of my favourite
      songs, and the mouse position decides which song to play. This is for now my personal music world of particles,
      but you can also make it yours by adding accompaniments! As you sing, the particles change speed and leaves
      beauitful traces. Try sing louder and be ready to watch a scene like meteor shower!
